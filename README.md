## Background

Before this list, there exist other lists to summarize the resources about SDN, such as [Google SDN Reading List](https://sites.google.com/site/sdnreadinglist/), [ONF Recommended SDN Reading List](https://www.opennetworking.org/sdn-resources/sdn-reading-list) and [Awesome SDN from sdnds-tw](https://github.com/sdnds-tw/awesome-sdn). But these lists only focus on one aspect of the *classic* research papers, *popular* opensource projects and well-known communities. In my opinion, a comprehensive list about all of the aspects I just mentioned is necessary. Both beginners and professional people will benefit from it.
